# Nike Trainer Top Sellers Analysis 
Scraping Nike's website to analyse the percentage of custom purchases in the top sellers of their men's trainer range.

Note: In the notebook the best sellers list was scraped at 16:00 on a Sunday and continually updates with a live data feed.

To develop this project it would be interesting to automate this code to run every hour and then log the percentage for every hour on all days of the week. 
It would be interesting whether it would be possible to validate or disprove the hypothesis of a potential trend being more custom shoe purchases are maded on the weekend when people have more free time to design the type of trainer they are looking for etc.
